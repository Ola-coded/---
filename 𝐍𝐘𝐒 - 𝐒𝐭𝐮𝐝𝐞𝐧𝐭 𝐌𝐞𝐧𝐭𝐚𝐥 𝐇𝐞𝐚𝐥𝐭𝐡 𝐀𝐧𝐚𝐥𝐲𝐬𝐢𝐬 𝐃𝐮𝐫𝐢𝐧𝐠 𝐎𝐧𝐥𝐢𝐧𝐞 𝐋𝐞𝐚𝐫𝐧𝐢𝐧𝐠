𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲

This analysis was conducted using Power BI, starting with the cleaning and transformation of student mental health data collected during online learning. Key metrics like screen time, physical activity, academic performance, and stress levels were modeled using DAX and visualized through interactive dashboards. Filters were applied for gender and education level to uncover trends and generate insights on how online learning impacts students’ well-being.
